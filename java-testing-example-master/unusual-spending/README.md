# unusual-spending

This project is for implementing the [Unusual Spending
Kata](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Unusual-Spending-Kata).
It is preconfigured with JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito for testing. It is also
set up to import the third-party dependencies needed by the kata and defined in
[unusual-spending-vendor](../unusual-spending-vendor).

To get started, write a Collaboration test for

three, or four parts.
